# RSGL Examples
Brief example test projects that show how you could impliment some concepts with RSGL

RSGLMake and RSGL are both required to compile the examples

run `[sudo] make RSGL` to install RSGL

run `[sudo] make RSGLMake` to install RSGL Make

After you have both installed you can compile the projects by going into that project's dirrectory and running `RSGLMake`

    cd "RSGL Dash"
    RSGLMake
